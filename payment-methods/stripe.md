# Stripe

This plugin integrates the Stripe Payment gateway with J2Store. It works and compatible with the latest Stripe API : 2014-01-31 (latest)

> NOTE: If you are using Stripe’s in built form, Please make sure that you have enabled SSL. If not, this might cause issues in the Stripe’s Javascript from loading on the site, thus blocking the checkout process.

With the purchase of Stripe integration, you would get access to two packages namely, **Stripe direct(The default checkout) and Stirpe checkout(Hosted).**

You could download both the packages from the My downloads section of the [J2Store site.](https://www.j2store.org/)

## Stripe direct Vs Stripe Hosted checkout <a href="#stripe-direct-vs-stripe-hosted-checkout" id="stripe-direct-vs-stripe-hosted-checkout"></a>

**Stripe direct** This is the standard version of Stripe plugin that most of you might have used until now. This integration offers three modes: 1. Normal form 2. Pop-up form 3. In-built form(Recommended)\
&#x20;Among the above three modes, only the In-built form supports SCA regulations that are in effect since September, 2019. Following is a guide on how to install and configure the Stripe Direct payment plugin.

**Stripe Hosted checkout**

The Hosted checkout transactions would take place in the Stripe payment window. So, you need not worry about SCA compliance since the transactions are handled by Stripe itself. Hence this integration is ideal for Merchants who wish to support both Normal and 3-D secure card payments.

Thus, once you have mentioned the necessary details for the above parameters, you are ready to receive payments via Stripe on your store.

## Stripe checkout(Hosted) <a href="#stripe-checkouthosted" id="stripe-checkouthosted"></a>

As mentioned in the introduction, Stripe Checkout(Hosted) is compliant to SCA by default since the transactions are handled by Stripe itself. Also, you need not worry about the payment method layout being responsive since users would be redirected to Stripe for the transactions.

## Configuring the Stripe Hosted checkout in your site <a href="#configuring-the-stripe-hosted-checkout-in-your-site" id="configuring-the-stripe-hosted-checkout-in-your-site"></a>

You could configure the Stripe Hosted payments on your site by following the below steps:

1. Retrieving the API keys
2. Installation
3. Connecting your store with Stripe

### Retrieving the API keys <a href="#retrieving-the-api-keys" id="retrieving-the-api-keys"></a>

The same keys used for Stripe direct can also be used to connect your store to Stripe hosted checkout as well.

### Installation <a href="#installation" id="installation"></a>

Use the Joomla extensions installer to install the plugin. Post installation, navigate to J2Store->Setup->Payment methods-> Enable the Stripe checkout plugin and edit the plugin to connect it with Stripe.

![Enable stripe checkout](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2023-09-07 15-24-21.png>)

### Connecting your store with Stripe Checkout <a href="#connecting-your-store-with-stripe-checkout" id="connecting-your-store-with-stripe-checkout"></a>

Once the API keys are retrieved, and the plugin is installed, the next step is to connect the store with your Stripe account.

Stripe Hosted checkout uses almost the same parameters as the Stripe direct payment method described above, except for the **Create/Update Webhook** parameter

![Parameters stripe hosted](../.gitbook/assets/Plugins-Stripe-Checkout-j4-Administration.png)

**Purpose of Webhooks on Stripe**

As mentioned above, with Stripe Hosted checkout, all the transactions occur in the Stripe window, so the merchant site has to be informed of the changes that occur with the transaction. Only then the corresponding orders can be updated on the merchant site. Webhooks are for this purpose. They are similar to IPN callbacks that are used as a communication between the Payment gateway and your ecommerce store.

**Update/ Create webhook** This option in the Stripe checkout wouldn’t have any values initially when you have just installed the plugin. However, after you enter the API keys in the plugin and save, a value would appear.

![No options in webhook](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/no-options-stripe-hosted.png)

Once you entered the credentials and saved the plugin, an **Update webhook** button would show up as follows:

&#x20;

![Update webhook](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot from 2023-09-07 15-16-51.png>)

**Where to find your site’s webhook in Stripe dashboard** Once you connect your store with Stripe by entering the API keys, there would be a webhook created in the Stripe dashboard. For the transactions to be updated in your J2Store orders, you will have to ensure that a webhook is created on your stripe dashboard.

To check this, navigate to Stripe dashboard->Developers->Webhooks.

![Webhooks in stripe](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/webhooks-stripe.png)

In the above screenshot, a webhook is created once for the corresponding store as indicated. This means that the transactions would be successfully communicated to the store that is connected to this account.

**When should you update your webhook?** If you have re-generated your Stripe API keys, then it means that your webhook should be updated. So, everytime you regenerate your Stripe API keys, make sure that you have updated the Webhook in your Stripe Checkout plugin.

**NOTE:** Without the webhook being generated, the status of the transactions would not be communicated with the J2Store orders. Hence, your order statuses would not be updated accordingly.

## SCA compliance <a href="#sca-compliance" id="sca-compliance"></a>

### Enabling SCA Compliance for Stripe direct <a href="#enabling-sca-compliance-for-stripe-direct" id="enabling-sca-compliance-for-stripe-direct"></a>

For the Stripe direct payment method, only the in-built mode supports SCA compliance. To enable SCA on Stripe direct, follow the below steps:

1. Navigate to J2Store->Setup->Payment methods->Stripe.
2. Set the option **Credit card form display type** to **Stripe in-built form**

![SCA in built mode](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/stripe-in-built-mode.png)

1. After choosing the Display mode as In-built form, enable the option **Enable payment intent(SCA Complaints) in Inbuilt form ?** to **YES**.

![Enabling payment intent](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/payment-intent.png)

Now, Stripe direct is compliant with SCA regulations.

## Testing SCA compliance <a href="#testing-sca-compliance" id="testing-sca-compliance"></a>

After enabling Payment intent on your Stripe direct plugin settings, you could test if the payment method is compatible with 3-D secure cards. Follow the below steps to test SCA compliance

1. Enable Sandbox mode in Stripe plugin.
2. Navigate to the storefront. Add a product to cart and initiate checkout process.
3. At the checkout, choose Stripe as your payment method.

![Testing Stripe SCA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/test-SCA-stripe.png)

1. Use the following cards:

&#x20;4000 0025 0000 3155 4000 0027 6000 3184 4000 0082 6000 3178 4000 0000 0000 3055

![3-d secure card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/3-d-secure-card.png) NOTE: You will not be able to test SCA Compliance if you use normal test cards. SCA compliance can be tested only with 3-D secure test cards.

1. Click on the Place order button to see the 3-D secure popup as follows:

![3-d secure popup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/3-d-secure-popup.png)

1. Click on **Complete authentication** to approve the transaction and complete the purchase.
2. The order should be placed and should be in **Confirmed** status as follows:

![Completed order](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/payment-methods/stripe/completed-order.png)

Now, we have tested that your Stripe payment method is compliant with the SCA regulations.

## Subscription Support for Stripe Checkout

We have now introduced Subscription support for the Stripe Checkout plugin.

Here is how you could test subscription support for Stripe checkout plugin.

### Testing Subscription Support for Stripe checkout

**Pre-requisites:**

* Stripe checkout plugin should be installed.
* API keys should be entered.

**Steps to be done:**

Following are the steps to be done to test if the Stripe hosted plugin works fine with the subscription product.

1. Placing a test order
2. Authenticating the transaction.
3. Completing the payment.

#### **Placing a test order**

* Add  a subscription product to the cart.
* Proceed to checkout and choose Stripe Hosted as the payment method.
* Once you click on the Place order button, you would be redirected to the Stripe page asking for the card details.
* Here is the document where you would find the test cards to be used. Click [here](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#regulatory-cards).
* Use one of the cards found in the above document and click on the Save card button at the popup. **First the card details entered would be saved and payment would not be processed.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_086.png)

#### Authenticating the transaction

* Once you click on Save card, you would see a popup asking for Authentication like this:

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_087.png)

#### Completing the payment

* Once the authentication is complete, you would be redirected to the Merchant site. Click on Go to order history button.
* Or, you can login to the My profile page, where you would see a **Complete Payment** button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_088.png)

* You would again be asked to authenticate. Click on the **Authenticate payment** button.

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_089.png)

* An authentication popup would come up. Click on Authenticate payment.

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_090.png)

* Now the payment would be completed and the order status should be confirmed.

![](../.gitbook/assets/selection\_091.png)

This indicates that the Stripe checkout plugin works fine with the Subscription product. You can set the payment live.

#### How it works for Recurring Payments

Once the initial order for the Subscription is confirmed, a renewal order would be generated under J2Store->Sales->Orders.

When the renewal due date approaches, if you have used a test card that requires authentication on all transactions(some cards mentioned[ here ](https://stripe.com/docs/testing#regulatory-cards)require authentication for all the payments as mentioned in the description), then you would receive a mail asking you to authenticate the payment.

If you have used a  card that requires a one-time authentication, the initial authentication is good enough. No further authentication would be requested. Once the renewal due date approaches, the payment would go through automatically.
