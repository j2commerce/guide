## Introduction <a href="#introduction" id="introduction"></a>

Our bookable product type allows you to set up bookable products for reservations, services, and rentals/hires. Bookings can be given customizable dates, cost, and duration, and can be purchased.

Here are the features that come in handy with the app:

## Flexible Booking slots <a href="#flexible-booking-slots" id="flexible-booking-slots"></a>

Create fixed or customer-defined booking slots. You can offer a block of dates or time slots for booking, or the customer can decide when to book your offerings.

## Bookable types <a href="#bookable-types" id="bookable-types"></a>

You can create bookable products based on date, time, a combination of date and time, or by month, customer-defined.

## Multi-person bookings <a href="#multi-person-bookings" id="multi-person-bookings"></a>

The customer can book for multiple persons. Example: 2 Adults and 3 Children. The pricing could be defined accordingly. You could offer a per-person discount as well.

## Availability <a href="#availability" id="availability"></a>

You can make only certain days or time slots available for booking. Example: A room could be booked only on August 24 and 25. The rest of the days or time slots would be unavailable for booking.

## Manage inventory <a href="#manage-inventory" id="manage-inventory"></a>

You can manage the bookable inventory in days or time slots. As soon as a bookable slot is full, it will not be available for customers to book.

## Booking multiple days <a href="#booking-multiple-days" id="booking-multiple-days"></a>

Let customers choose multiple days for booking a resource. Example: A car could be rented on September 20,21,22,23. The customer could choose all four days and book. The pricing could reflect his selection.

## Custom-tailored booking costs <a href="#custom-tailored-booking-costs" id="custom-tailored-booking-costs"></a>

You can define the cost of the booking made. Apart from the regular price of the product, every block could have an additional cost.

## Calendar views <a href="#calendar-views" id="calendar-views"></a>
