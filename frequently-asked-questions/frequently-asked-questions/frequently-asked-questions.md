## Vat not appears in check out <a id="vat-not-appears-in-check-out"></a>

In Configuration - Tax, tax is set to be applied on the shipping address

In the tax profile, it is set to apply billing address.

For the tax rates to show up fine at the cart estimation and the checkout, the associated addresses at the Tax profile and the J2Store configuration tax tab should match.

## Donation plugin is empty.Why? <a id="donation-plugin-is-emptywhy"></a>

The donation app adds a Donation option type. 

* So go to j2store -&gt; catalog -&gt;options. 
* Create a New option.

* Save.

**Associating the Donation option to the product:**

* Open your product \(simple should work good\).

* Search for the donation option you just created.
* Add it and save.

## Multiple stores / different notification receiver depending on category <a id="multiple-stores--different-notification-receiver-depending-on-category"></a>

J2Store is a B2C solution where you can maintain only one store. It does not support multi-store system. As a result, when an order is placed, all the store administrators will be notified.

If you just want the email notifications to be controlled and made dependent on the category,then a custom app could be developed that will send email for the party concerned.

2. Setting under Edit Product &gt; shipping tab

* Enable shipping.
* The configured shipping rates with shipping rates does has an entry with matching rate. For eg: In case the item has 829 grams, you have to configure a rate between 800 and 1000 and the estimate shipping lists the rate.

## Why the order is listed in the backend even didnâ€™t make a payment? How to see the paid products? <a id="why-the-order-is-listed-in-the-backend-even-didnt-make-a-payment-how-to-see-the-paid-products"></a>

The purpose of the order status column is to differentiate between the new, paid, pending orders.If the order status is NEW, then no payment has been made.

If you do not like the word NEW, you can change it. Go to J2Store - Localisation - Order status.Edit NEW and change it to something like UNPAID

## Why the order is listed in the backend : <a id="why-the-order-is-listed-in-the-backend-"></a>

When customer reaches the last step of Checkout, we have to save the data as the order. Because, when he clicks Place order, he will be redirected to PayPal. That also means we will lose the data if we did not save. So J2Store saves the order as NEW.

When a payment is successfully made, the order status will be set to CONFIRMED. So by looking at the order status, you can differentiate which orders are paid which are not.

There is a marketing opportunity as well. You can follow up with the unpaid customers and convert them.

## Grid layout not working/columns.Why? <a id="grid-layout-not-workingcolumnswhy"></a>

The issue seems to be the wrong sub-template. Open your product list layout menu. In Common options tab -&gt; set the sub-template as Bootstrap3. Save

This should solve the issue. If it is already set to Bootstrap 3, then try to set it as Default.
