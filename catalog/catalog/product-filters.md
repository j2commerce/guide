# Product filters

These are used to narrow out the search for a particular product.

In this page, first Filter Groups are created and in each group some Filter Names will be added, and based on the Filter Name, products will be searched.

* E.g., Filter Group : Clothing
* Filter Names: Mens, Women, Kids

```text
NOTE: If you are adding a large number of filters (1000+), make sure "max_input_vars" in your PHP.ini is set to a higher number as well
```

This is illustrated in the image below:
