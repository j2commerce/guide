# Translate J2Commerce into your language

Translating J2Commerce into your language is very easy. All the language files are managed in Transifex, an effective localization platform. This guide should help you get J2Commerce to work in your language with a few easy steps.

## Check existing translations <a href="#check-existing-translations" id="check-existing-translations"></a>

Go to [click here](https://docs.j2store.org/translation/\[http://J2Store.org/translations.html]\(%3Chttp:/J2Store.org/translations.html%3E\)) to check if the translation for your language is available. If you see your language listed and the progress bar indicating 100 %, then you can click on the name of your language to download the translation pack.

![Transifex packages](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/translation-transifex-packages.png)

It is an installable pack. You can install it via Joomla! installer.

## Translations for my language are not complete <a href="#translations-for-my-language-is-not-complete" id="translations-for-my-language-is-not-complete"></a>

If you see that the translation for your language is not complete or don’t see your language listed at all, you need to translate the J2Commerce. Don’t worry. It is easy to translate J2Commerce to your language. Transifex makes it easy.

**Step 1:** Go to [click here](https://docs.j2store.org/translation/\[http://transifex.com]\(%3Chttp:/transifex.com%3E\)) and create an account. It's FREE.

**Step 2:** Joomla has a group of volunteers for translation. The group works under the name of Open Translators. It's a hub project for the translation of all Joomla! extensions. So, go to the Open Translators hub project by [clicking here](https://docs.j2store.org/translation/\[https://opentranslators.transifex.com]\(%3Chttps:/opentranslators.transifex.com%3E\))

![Transifex open translators](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/translation-transifex-opentranslators.png)

You will see almost all languages listed there. In case you don't find your language, you can request a language. But that won't be necessary as all the languages are already listed.

So go ahead and click your language. Say, you need a German translation. Click the German language. This will take you to the German translations page listing translations for all extensions of Joomla.

**Step 3:** Join the team of your language. You can find the Join team button on the top right of the page. See the image below

![Transifex germany](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/translation-transifex-germany.png)

It would take some time for the coordinators of the language team to approve your joining request.

**Step 4:** Once you have joined, [click here](https://docs.j2store.org/translation/\[https://opentranslators.transifex.com]\(%3Chttps:/opentranslators.transifex.com%3E\)) and choose J2Commerce from a list of child projects. Start typing a few letters in the box, and you can get to see the J2Commerce project. See the image below.

Once you choose J2Commerce, you can see a list of the language resources. They are normally the standard Joomla language ini files for the admin and site side of the J2Store component. We call these files in Transifex resources. ![Transifex-resources](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/translation-transifex-resources.png)

**Step 5**

Click a resource to start translating. For example, click on the J2Commerce → admin\_com\_J2Store\_menu. This will open a pop-up.

![Transifex german resource](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/translation-transifex-resource-germany.png)

Click on the translate now. This will take you to the translations management window.

![J2Store management window](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j2store/doc-images/master/translation/Translate-j2store-to-your-lang/Translation-transifex-J2Store-management-win.png)

In the top right corner, you can see the source language and the language of the file being translated.

The left column lists the strings. Clicking on a string will present space to enter your translations.

Once you have translated all the strings, click save and exit.

Translate all the language resources in the same fashion.
