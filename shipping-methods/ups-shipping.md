## How to obtain UPS OAuth Credentials:

The following instructions will help walk you through the process of obtaining your new UPS OAuth Client ID and Client Secret.&#x20;

**Step 4:** Then I need API credentials because: I want to integrate UPS technology into my business.

**Step 5:** On same page as #4: Select the client's UPS account you need to link it to

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/ups-add-account.webp" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Step 6:** Complete the contact info

**Step 7:** Then select the Rating, Tracking, and Time In Transit API's (I believe the Authorization(OAuth) is automatically added when you save)

(Right now, we aren't using the Tracking API, but we do plan on incorporating that in later versions so better to add it now so you don't need to worry about adding it later...)

**Step 8:** After saving, you should be able to see the Client ID and client Secret under the App Info/Credentials page
