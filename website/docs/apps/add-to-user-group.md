Now you can create as many unique groups as you need so you can organize your customers.  This will be very helpful when wanting to send a specific group of customers marketing material, promotions, new products, etc.&#x20;

For example: If your customer is buying a digital product you can add them to a special digital group or if they are an important shopper you can add them to a VIP shopper group and give them special access to certain products or documents.

**Step 7:** To create a new group go to Users > groups > New. Now name it whatever you want. In this example we have named it VIP Shoppers.&#x20;
