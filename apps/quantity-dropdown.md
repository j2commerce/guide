# Quantity dropdown

This app allows your store to update the price of a product based on quantity on the product page itself. Your product page normally displays the price for a unit quantity of a product. When a customer selects a higher quantity of the product, he can view the total price of the product only in his cart. But with this app, he can automatically view the updated price for a higher quantity of the product on the same product page.

**Configuration**

**Enable price update on quantity change to all products?**

Setting this option to **YES** will enable the dropdown quantity box for all products.

**Quantity box type?**

Choose the type of quantity box to be displayed. There are two types of quantity boxes offered by this app: Dropdown and Default. The Dropdown type would display the quantity box in a dropdown format, and the Default type would display the quantity box in J2Commerce’s normal quantity field format.

**Pre-defined quantity (in a comma-separated format)**

The quantity dropdown would render the quantity values entered here. You could enter the values in a comma (,) separated format. For example: 10,20,30,40,50

**Should a placeholder —Select— text be displayed instead of defaulting to the first option?** Choose this if you would like to force the customer to choose a quantity in the dropdown.

**Restrict the display of the dropdown to selected user groups?**

You could restrict the display of the quantity box based on user groups. The quantity box would be visible to the users who belong to the user group selected here.

**Enable using a Factor?**

Set this option to YES if you would like to generate a quantity list using a factor (example: 5. This should create a list of quantities in increments of 5: example. 5,10,15,20)

**Quantity Factor**

If you have enabled the above option, then you will have to mention the factor here. For example: Enter 5.

**Maximum limit for the quantity list when the factor is used**

The maximum quantity should be mentioned here. For example: Enter 50. Now the quantity list will be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50.

\*\*Multiply Price based on Qty? \*\*

Setting this option to YES would display the price multiplied by the quantity. For example, consider the price of the product is 12. So when you change the quantity to 5, then it would display 60.

\*\*Enable cart quantity \*\*

If you would like to replace the quantity box in the items table on the cart page with a quantity dropdown, set this option to YES.

\*\*Quantity pre-text and post-text \*\*

Text entered here will be added as a prefix and suffix to the quantity number. For example, if you entered Gram in the Post text box, then the quantity will appear like 5 gram, 10 gram, 15 gram, etc..
