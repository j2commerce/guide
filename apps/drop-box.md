# Drop-box

## Requirements <a href="#requirements" id="requirements"></a>

1. PHP 8.1.0 +
2. Joomla! 4.x/ Joomla! 5.x +
3. J2Commerce / J2Store 4.x +

Sell your files stored in dropbox with J2Commerce Joomla! eCommerce platform. The app enables you to connect your dropbox and sell the files securely.

**Important Notes**

**NOTE 1:**

The download link sent in the email uses the Dropbox API’s method to create a temporary url.

The API does not allow us to set a custom expiry date (like in Amazon S3). Dropbox itself sets the expiry time. _**The link expires after a few hours.**_

After the link expires, the customer cannot download using that link. He will have to visit the site, login and then click the Download. This would create another temporary download URL and allow the customer to download.

Now there are two ways of solving this

1. You can mention in the email that the link is valid only for a few hours. if it expired, customers have to login to your site to download the file.
2. Dropbox API now allows creating a permanent sharable link. Once created it is valid till your file is removed from Dropbox.

You can use the app’s settings to choose whether to send a temporary URL or permanent URL. In your app’s settings, you can see the following parameter

**Choose the type of link to be included in the email**

* Choose Send a Temporary link if you wants to send temporary link to your customers. This URL will expire in few hours.
* Choose Send a Sharable link if you wants to send permanent link. This URL never expires unless you delete the shared file in your Dropbox account.

**NOTE 2:**

\*\*Before proceeding with with setup for the app, make sure you defined a local folder path in Components > J2Commerce > Setup > Configuration > Basic settings (example: media ).
