* Go to 'J2Commerce' (or J2Store cart) tab and scroll down where you can see the navigation menus (General, images, Relations, apps)
* In the 'general' tab, choose 'YES' to be visible in the storefront and navigate to apps.
* Go to the 'apps' tab, where you can see the search box to search for the products.
* Type two or three characters of your product. You can either type the name or SKU #.
* If the product you are searching for is not listed, the reason is that the product might have /variants. Since this app allows only the product without options/variants, the product with options cannot be added into the group.

**Usecase**

Let’s imagine the scenario where you own an online bookstore and you wish to sell both the physical book and the digital copy of the book; then, grouped products could be a boon to you.

Grouped product comes in handy, especially when you don’t want the user to go searching for the physical book in two different places, and when you wish to allow the buyer to choose whether to buy the physical product or the digital copy of the product. Now, let us get to know how to create a grouped product for the above scenario.

Procedure to be followed

* Create a simple product for the physical product, specifying the images, price, discount, and stock information, if any.
* Create a downloadable product for the digital product, mentioning the product price, file to be downloaded after purchase, download limit, link expiry limit, and so on.
* Create a product of the type “Grouped product”.
* Navigate to the Apps section, and you will find the option to add other products to the group.
* Add the products that you wish to group into a bundle and save the article.
* Associate the grouped product with a category and link that category to a menu.
* Now the grouped product will be available at the frontend.
