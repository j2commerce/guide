# Ask question / quote

This app allows customer to enquire a product or to ask quote for a product through mail.

* J2Store 3.2.x or above

**Switch off catalog mode:**

**NOTE:** **If you are having the shop in catalog mode, the ask quote button wouldnâ€™t come up on the storefront.**

Alternatively, you could turn off the catalog mode and hide the add to cart buttons in the site using the **Hide add to cart button for all products?** in the basic settings of the Ask quote plugin.

**Installation**
