## 1. Accepting recurring payments in Joomla <a href="#1-accepting-recurring-payments-in-joomla" id="1-accepting-recurring-payments-in-joomla"></a>

Recurring payments are transactions that occur on a repetitious basis, such as a subscription service where payments are charged for a pre-determined duration of time.

## 2. Selling one-time subscriptions with manual renewals <a href="#2-selling-one-time-subscriptions-with-manual-renewals" id="2-selling-one-time-subscriptions-with-manual-renewals"></a>

A Non Recurring Charge is a one time invoice, whether an admin manually creates it or someone registers online.

For example, now we are going to create a subscription product “Reward Box”. The duration of this subscription product is for only one month. At the end of one month, the subscriber have to manually renewal his / her subscription if they wish to continue receiving reward box from store. Follow the instructions given below to setup the non renewal subscription product:

## 4. Selling memberships in your Joomla website <a href="#4-selling-memberships-in-your-joomla-website" id="4-selling-memberships-in-your-joomla-website"></a>

Lets consider you are selling online courses. While selling online courses, you may wants users to limit their access to whole site. This can be possible by providing membership. For example, setup membership like free, professional and Gold.

Subscribing for Free, allows users to access only specific courses.

Subscribing for the membership plan “Professional” allows users to access all courses available in the site for specific period of time. And customer support will be available.

Subscribing for the membership plan “Gold” allows customers to access all courses, video tutorials, and several online tests.
